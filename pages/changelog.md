### New Content
- **Assassin's Creed Valhalla:** Added a gallery with six new images.

### Website Maintenance and Modernization
- **Resolved Jekyll Build Issues:**  Fixed a series of configuration and dependency problems that were preventing the site from building and serving correctly.  This involved:
    - Correcting the Jekyll version in the `Gemfile`.
    - Adding required gems (`ostruct`, `wdm`) to the `Gemfile`.
    - Removing the incompatible `jekyll-cache` plugin (and updating `_config.yml` accordingly).
    - Ensuring the `jekyll` gem was explicitly listed as a dependency.
    - Correcting a syntax error (missing `end`) in the `Gemfile`.
- **Modernized Sass:**  Updated the Sass stylesheets to use the modern `@use` and `@forward` rules, replacing the deprecated `@import` rule. This involved:
    - Moving Sass partials (`.scss` files) to the correct `assets/css` directory.
    - Updating `@import` statements to `@use` or `@forward` as appropriate.
    - Defining Sass variables within the partials where they are used, ensuring correct scoping.
    - Removing unnecessary front matter from `main.scss`.
    - Correcting file paths and names.

### Updates
- Updated the scroll bar to seamlessly integrate with the websiteâ€™s design.
