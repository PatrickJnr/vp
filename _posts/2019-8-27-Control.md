trivia:
  - "Control is set in the same universe as Alan Wake and features several connections to the game, including a DLC expansion that directly ties the two stories together."
  - "The game's Oldest House setting is heavily inspired by the architecture of Brutalist buildings, particularly the real-life FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C."
